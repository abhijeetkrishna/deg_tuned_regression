<p align="center"> Automated tuning of degree for polynomial regrssion using Scikit-Learn
    <br> 
</p>


## About <a name = "about"></a>
Often you might need to fit a polynomial for different features. A degree of polynomial that looks good for one feature may not look good for another. Hence I made this short code to automatically choose the degree of polynomial that makes the most sense for a single feature. This code can then be looped for multiple features.
